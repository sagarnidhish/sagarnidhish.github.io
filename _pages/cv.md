Research Experience
======
* Hybrid Modeling: Mechanistic Algebraic Learning via Elastic Net (Jan 2023 - Present), MIT
  * Advisors: Prof. Richard Braatz and Prof. Ericmoore Jossou
  * Collaborating with Dow Inc. (for industry data) to build hybrid models for industrial chemical processes
  * Working on nonlinear processes like pH control, catalyst deactivation and convective mass transfer
  * Incorporating physical constraints while optimizing process conditions; neural networks and other ML models being used
  * Manuscript under review with funding agency

* Evaluating Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials for Disordered Rocksalts (Aug 2020 - Aug 2022)
  * Indian Institute of Science
  * Advisor: Prof. Sai Gautam Gopalakrishnan
  * Analyzed the effects of dataset size and complexity on training times, and to compare different machine-learned interatomic potential models on disordered materials (DRX) datasets
  * Performed DFT calculations on 11000+ structures composed of 11 unique elements in various combinations
  * Hyperparameter optimization was done on all ML models used
  * Materials Research Society (MRS) Spring Meet 2022 Abstract accepted for Oral presentation
  * Work published in Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation 2024 (JCTC) https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00039

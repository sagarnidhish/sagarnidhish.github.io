<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

Welcome! I'm **Nidhish Sagar**, a dual Master's student at **MIT**, specializing in **Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS)** and **Nuclear Science & Engineering (NSE)**. My research focus is on leveraging **Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Science**, with particular interests in **physics-informed machine learning**, **hybrid modeling**, and **multimodal techniques**.

Currently, I work on hybrid models that integrate mechanistic and data-driven approaches to optimize industrial chemical processes. I've also published research on how machine learning can solve challenges in materials science. Based on the courses I have taken at MIT, I've developed a keen interest in applying AI to discover insights into scientific phenomena whose data have complex mathematical relationships. 

Previously, my research has spanned diverse topics such as:
- Machine-learned interatomic potentials for disordered rocksalts.
- Functionalization of 2D materials for hydrogen evolution reactions.

With a strong technical foundation, I enjoy working at the intersection of **machine learning** and **scientific domains**, exploring how data and algorithms can transform our understanding of complex systems. My efforts have resulted in peer-reviewed publications and international conference presentations (most recently at NeurIPS 2024).

Beyond academics, I’m deeply passionate about teaching and giving back to the community. Beside research, I am a tutor at [**MIT’s ESOL program**](https://hr.mit.edu/diversity-equity-inclusion/esol), teaching English to non-native staff (includes many janitors) at MIT.

I am into long-distance running, having won medals in my university.

When I’m not working on my projects, you can find me experimenting with coding challenges, exploring new AI frameworks, or enjoying a game of chess. I aim to create a positive impact wherever I go, and am a big believer in working with people.

Feel free to explore my **research**, and **blog** for more insights into my journey. Please feel free to reach out (links on the left) if you’d like to collaborate and/or discuss shared interests!
